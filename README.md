 Efficiency, thermal, and sizing models for brushless DC motor powertrains used in drones and robots.

 This are models I've developed over the past few years of graduate research at Texas A&M University.
 I want them to see the light of day rather sit unread in a journal paper.
I welcome your feedback!

POSTED models:
Efficiency models = predict losses for a brushless DC (BLDC) motor, motor controller (also known as electronic speed controller or ESC), and a generic lithium-polymer ("Lipo") battery.

TO-BE POSTED:
Theory manual for efficiency models (open-source journal paper explaining efficiency models)
Thermal models + theory manual = predict convective heat transfer coefficient for outrunner BLDC motor.
Sizing models + theory manual = predict optimal size and electrical constants for outrunner BLDC motor.
